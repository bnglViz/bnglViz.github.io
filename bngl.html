    <h2>What is BNGL?</h2>

    <p>Rule-based modeling is based on the representation of biological objects (declared as molecules but in fact 
    may be representing any objects from protein domains to humans or ecosystems) as objects with a set of attributes 
    (called sites) that may take a finite number of states. </p>

    <p>Molecular interactions are defined as rules for transforming the attributes of these objects. 
    The approach allows one to systematically incorporate site-specific details about protein-protein interactions 
    into a model for the dynamics of a signal-transduction system [ref], 
    but the method has other applications as well, such as following the fates of 
    individual carbon atoms in metabolic reactions [ref]. </p>
    
    <p>A rule-based models are defined in several languages (BioNetGenLanguage BNGL [ref], Kappa language [ref], ML-rules [ref]) and can be processed 
        by several software tools such as BioNetGen, Kappa, ....  Here, we focus on easy visual representation of 
        rule-based model specified in the 
    BioNetGen language (BNGL). 

      <h3>Molecules</h3>  

In the EGFR model [ref] we consider several molecules. Here we consider in details two: "egf" molecule (ligand) has a single site "r", 
        while "egfr" molecule (receptor) has four sites: "l", "r", "Y1068" and "Y1073". Two last sites 
        can be in two mutually-exclusivestates each:  either "u" or "p".
